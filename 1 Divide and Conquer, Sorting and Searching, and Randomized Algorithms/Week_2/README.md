# Count Inversions

Inversion Count for an array indicates – how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is 
already sorted, then the inversion count is 0, but if not sorted and array is  A[1... n],
for every i < j, find all inversion pairs such that A[i] > A[j].[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9RQh21KrH8)
